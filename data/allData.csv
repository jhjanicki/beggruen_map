Humans make a substantial contribution to this with their behavior and destroy the bases of life of their own generation as well as the following generations.

It is a forum for scientific policy advice at the nexus of global environmental change and health with the aim of achieving a sustainable and equitable transformation of social systems in Germany and the world. With CPHP we are aiming to stimulate and support socio-political debates on health within planetary boundaries. Together with health actors, policy-makers, and researchers, we develop options for action along the questions depicted in our first policy brief and others. For example: How can planetary health as a vision for the future be established as a standing item on national and international political agendas permanently and effectively? How can health equity and environmental justice be consolidated in (health) policy decisions? What kind of partnerships are necessary for planetary health? In addition to that, we want to connect with actors from other policy fields; because health is not only shaped by the health sector but all policy areas. To that end, we will also look beyond Germany. In view of the urgency of overcoming the planetary crises, new forms of cooperation are needed to ensure the habitability of the planet for future generations and their health.",Maike Voss (Director),"Planetary, health, sustainability, planetary boundaries, socio-political, justice, healthcare","

They examine how bodies of knowledge originally devised to address specific local problems became universalized.

The Leverhulme Centre for Anthropocene Biodiversity redresses this imbalance, recognising biological gains as well as losses, and changes that are beneficial to humans as well as ones that are harmful.

2. The challenges and threats we face today are complex, changing and increasingly unpredictable, and the need to address them is more urgent than ever.
3. We need to make a qualitative leap in our knowledge and understanding of the issues, as well as in global governance and collective decision-making, in order to find and implement effective solutions. This leap can only be made by embracing a new approach that enables us to work integratively, drawing on the various disciplines of our current knowledge.

These are: to foster independent, critical inquiry into the complexities and paradoxes of change in South Africa; to conduct this enquiry by drawing intensively on comparative international research especially from the African continent; to foreground the global theoretical significance of WISER’s research agenda; to combine aesthetic and social scientific analyses; and to provide an institutional space that strengthens the scholarly dialogue between South African researchers and academics in the rest of the world.

His writing and teaching focus on the theoretical, conceptual and methodological dimensions of urban questions, and on the challenges of reinventing our approach to urbanization in relation to the crises, contradictions and struggles of our time.  Brenner has made influential contributions to scholarly debates on critical urban theory, the critique of capitalist urbanization, urban restructuring, state space, the political economy of rescaling, variegated neoliberalization and planetary urbanization.  His current work is focused on the question of how “hinterlands”—the non-city territories, infrastructures and ecologies that support urban life—are being remade under contemporary supply-chain capitalism.  This inquiry aims to connect the study of urbanization more directly to the analysis not only of primary commodity production (the historical geographies of agro-industrial and extractive capitalism) but also to the critical exploration of contemporary environmental crises and emergent struggles for postfossil—and postcapitalist—planetary futures.
